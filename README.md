# Hello 👋🏻 I'm Aarushi Sharma

👩🏻‍💻 **About Me**

- 🎓 Master’s student in Data Science @ RIT  
- 🔍 Exploring the world of **Data Engineering** & **Backend Systems**
- 🐝 Passionate about building tech that connects data with real-world impact (ask me about my beehive project!)
- 🛠️ Tools of the trade: Python, SQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, Kafka, Redis, PySpark, FastAPI, Docker
- 📚 Coursework: Databases, Distributed Systems, Stream Processing, Responsible AI

🚀 **What I’m Working On**
- Real-time credit card transaction system using **Kafka + MySQL + PySpark**
- Graph-powered music insights using **Neo4j + D3.js** (🎵 *Graph & Roll*)
- Mental health tracking app (coming soon 💭)

🌱 **Currently Learning**
- Apache Airflow & dbt for orchestration and transformation
- Advanced Redis & caching strategies

🤝 **Looking to Collaborate On**
- Data infrastructure projects (batch + stream)
- Visualization dashboards or anything graph-related!

💬 **Ask Me About**
- Graph modeling with Neo4j  
- MongoDB aggregation pipelines  
- Or debugging Python scripts under pressure 😅

⚡ **Fun Fact**
- I love bees. No really. I built a whole project around them 🐝
